    "2. A generator in python makes use of the ‘yield’ keyword. A python iterator doesn’t.\n",
    "3. Python generator saves the states of the local variables every time ‘yield’ pauses the loop in python. An iterator does not make use of local variables, all it needs is iterable to iterate on.\n",
    "4. A generator may have any number of ‘yield’ statements.\n",
    "5. You can implement your own iterator using a python class; a generator does not need a class in python.\n",
    "6. To write a python generator, you can either use a Python function or a comprehension. But for an iterator, you must use the iter() and next() functions.\n",
    "7. Generator in python let us write fast and compact code. This is an advantage over Python iterators. They are also simpler to code than do custom iterator.\n",
    "8. Python iterator is more memory-efficient. "

    "2. List comprehension allows filtering. In map, we have no such facility. For example, to print all even numbers in range of 100, we can write [n for n in range(100) if n%2 == 0]. There is no alternate for it in map\n",
    "3. List comprehension are used when a list of results is required as map only returns a map object and does not return any list.\n",
    "4. List comprehension is faster than map when we need to evaluate expressions that are too long or complicated to express\n",
