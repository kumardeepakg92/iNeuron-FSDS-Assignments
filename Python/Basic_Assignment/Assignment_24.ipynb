    "\n",
    "Ans-A lambda function is a small anonymous function. A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result."

    "\n",
    "They are generally used when a function is needed temporarily for a short period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using lambda function, you can define a function and call it immediately at the end of definition. This can’t be done with def functions."

    "\n",
    "The filter() Function, Similar to map(), filter() takes a function object and an iterable and creates a new list. filter() forms a new list that contains only elements that satisfy a certain condition, i.e. the function we passed returns True.\n",

    "Ans-Function annotations are arbitrary python expressions that are associated with various part of functions. These expressions are evaluated at compile time and have no life in python’s runtime environment. "
